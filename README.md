# GDGChallenge_25

This project is a template/framework showing the barebones working of the entire thing, and vibecoded too.

Run 
    - npm install
to get the dependencies up and running.

Also, don't forget to pull the repo before pushing, in order to avoid merge conflicts as much as possible :)
